# api.haxe.org - Haxe Standard API documentation website

[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org)

This repository hosts the api.haxe.org website.

As an overview, a program in the master branch takes the documentation xml files generated by the Haxe compiler and turn them into html pages using [dox](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox).

For every commit in the development branch and tags in the [haxe repo](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe), [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/haxe) commits the xml files to the [xml](xml) folder. The [TravisCI build of **this** repo](https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org) will then take care of generating the pages, and than commit the output to the gh-pages branch, which is the source of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## development info

To generate the pages locally, run the commands in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml), except you don't run the `haxe --run DeployGhPages` line at the end for obvious reason.

The html/css/js template files reside in the [theme](theme) folder. The theme inherits [dox default](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox/tree/master/themes/default).

The haxelib dependencies are managed as submodules in the [libs](libs) folder. We do not use lib.haxe.org just because we often evolve the dependencies in parallel to Haxe development, and it is troublesome to make proper releases...
