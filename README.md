# api.haxe.org - Haxe Standard API documentation website

[![Build Status](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository hosts the api.haxe.org website.

As an overview, a program in the master branch takes the documentation xml files generated by the Haxe compiler and turn them into html pages using [dox](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox).

For every commit in the development branch and tags in the [haxe repo](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/actions) commits the xml files to the [xml](xml) folder. The [GitHub Actions build of **this** repo](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/api.haxe.org/actions) will then take care of generating the pages, and then deploy.

## development info

To generate the pages locally, run `earthly +html`.

The html/css/js template files reside in the [theme](theme) folder. The theme inherits [dox default](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox/tree/master/themes/default).

The haxelib dependencies are managed as submodules in the [libs](libs) folder. We do not use lib.haxe.org just because we often evolve the dependencies in parallel to Haxe development, and it is troublesome to make proper releases...
